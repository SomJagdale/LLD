Singleton design pattern

Only one object or instance of class is created and shared between all user classes

How to achive?
1. Make constructor private, create one private static pointer instance variable of class type 
2. Create one public access level static function so we can call it without creating its instance, since static function are class funtion rather than object function
3. As a extraprecaution create copyconstructor and assignment operator also private
4. If possible create that public function thread safe
